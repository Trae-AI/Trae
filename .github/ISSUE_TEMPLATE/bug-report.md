Hello, to further improve the efficiency of handling bugs, we have tried using Feishu collection forms to gather bug information. In the collection form, you can fill in according to the pattern we have set, which will greatly improve our efficiency in handling bugs. Thank you very much!

üîó Collection form link: https://bytedance.larkoffice.com/share/base/form/shrcnDFG2R6qqguSROt9GYUnSTc

‚ö†Ô∏è After filling out the questionnaire, do not repeat the issue
‚ö†Ô∏è Please pay attention to the Feishu account you used for filling out the form. We may contact you further.

Thank you very much for your feedback!
